# Hi Guys! 
This read me is gonna include a couple of house-cleaning things.

1. To push your changes I suggest you clone the repo first, this is going to lower the chance of files being corrupted.
2. Once you do that create new files and copy what you've been working on independently into the file you created in the cloned project
3. Make your own branches and do all of your work and fixes there until you are ready to push every thing to the Main branch

I think thats it for now!

# We can do this guys :3!
